In this workshop i got to learn about how to create exeptions and use them within code, i used it in constructor of SpellChecker class where exception is used. 
I also  learnt about Lambda expressions. When the functionality offered by the lambda is straightforward and can be stated in a single expression, a lambda expression is generally employed. 
Both the Movie and  Book class members had  default constructors. It shouldn't be like this
Removed because no arguments are passed in the array, so the standard constructor is used to create an array of objects 
Creation.
