I've learned a lot about algorithms and standard libraries from this workshop.

Algorithms are one of the crucial topics identified in the course that call for further practise, and I've always wanted to learn them.

STL algorithms are effective because they do the desired task faster.

Algorithms are replaceable ,  because loops are so concentrated, they are difficult to change once in place.

In my perspective, it also makes the code easier to read and less convoluted.
I now know how to transfer the data from the file and put it in a container that is sequential.
To compile the data values from the file, I utilised the numeric library.
